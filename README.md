Circle_Hero

Empower your aim with Circle Hero, a simple aim trainer written completely in Java.

Installation and Execution:  
1. Download and extract the zip file.
2. Once extracted, open the dist folder.
3. There are two versions; CircleHero is the main application and CircleHeroSmall is for smaller screens. If CircleHero appears broken, try CircleHeroSmall.

Controls:  
Play- Opens up the main Circle Hero game.
Settings- Adjust the circle size, amount, and game mode.
Back(<-)- Brings back to main menu.
"r"- Press "r" during play to reset the round

How to Play:  
3 Circles at a time will appear in the main panel. 
Once the first circle is clicked, the game will start and the counter will start incrementing after the first circle was clicked.
Game ends when enough circles have been clicked.

Score: Score = (Accuracy * Total Circles) / Seconds 
(Seconds used aren't completely accurate and last slightly longer than a normal second)
Accuracy: Total Circles / Total Clicks

Settings:
Circle Size- Adjusts the diameter of the circles in pixels.
Total- Sets total amount of circles the be clicked each round.
Standard Mode- Click the circles, missclicks will count towards accuracy.
Easy Mode- No need to click, just aim at the circles and accuracy is automatically 100%. (May be buggy)
Sudden Death Mode- Missclicking a circle resets the entire round.

Save- Adjusts settings to new values.
Reset- Resets back to default settings. (Size = 80, Total = 50, Mode = Standard)
Back(<-)- Goes back to main menu without adjusting any settings.

My first project using Java swing GUI, if you can get a score of 500 at default settings, you're legally insane! :)
